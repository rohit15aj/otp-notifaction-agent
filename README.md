# OTP Smart Notification Agent

A lightweight agent that automatically detects and separates important OTP notifications from spam messages.

## Problem

## Solution
This project uses simple rule-based logic to classify notification text into OTP and non-OTP categories in real time.

## How it Works
- Takes notification text as input
- Checks for OTP-related keywords
- Separates OTP messages from spam
- Displays a clear summary for the user

## Tech Stack
- Python

## Demo
A short demo video is provided in the hackathon submission.
